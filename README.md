# Brief Synopsis of Project Scope

The project essentially consisted of 5 stages: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, then a model 
comparing three factors to how well each could predict our target, price.

Tha factors that underwent regression models were square footage, which was refined to look exclusively the indoor square footage of the properties as the best explanatory variable, latitude/longtitude and zipcode.
